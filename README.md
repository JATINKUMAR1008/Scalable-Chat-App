# Fullstack Chat Application

This repository contains the source code for a real-time chat application built with a modern fullstack architecture. The application is developed using Next.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, with real-time communication handled by Socket.io. Redis is used for pub/sub messaging, SQLite serves as the database, and Prisma ORM manages database interactions. The project is organized and managed using Turborepo.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **apps/**: Contains the main applications for the project.
  - **frontend/**: The Next.js application that serves as the frontend of the chat application.
  - **backend/**: The Express.js server that handles API requests, real-time socket connections, and database operations.

- **packages/**: Shared code and configurations that are used across multiple apps, such as utility functions, shared components, or common configurations.

- **.eslintrc.js**: Configuration file for ESLint, used to maintain code quality and consistency throughout the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, ensuring sensitive and unnecessary files are not committed to the repository.

- **.npmrc**: Configuration file for npm, managing package-related settings.

- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview and documentation for the project.

- **package-lock.json**: Lock file for npm, ensuring consistent dependency installation across environments.

- **package.json**: Defines the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the overall project managed by Turborepo.

- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file, specifying compiler options for the entire project.

- **turbo.json**: Configuration file for Turborepo, managing the monorepo structure and build processes.

- **yarn.lock**: Lock file for Yarn, ensuring consistent dependency resolution across installations.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Implemented using Socket.io, enabling instant messaging and updates across connected clients.
  
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Redis is used as a pub/sub mechanism to handle real-time communication efficiently across the server.

- **Database**: SQLite is used for data storage, with Prisma ORM for database management and interactions.

- **Monorepo Management**: The project is structured as a monorepo using Turborepo, allowing for efficient code sharing and build processes across different applications and packages.

## Setup and Installation
